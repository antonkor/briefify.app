# 2025-01-19 - Spec 009: Blog Content Analytics System

## Session Summary
Created specification for an automated blog content analytics system that would transform development artifacts (journal entries, commit messages) into blog-ready content with intelligent tagging and categorization.

## Spec 009 Details
- **Branch**: `009-blog-schema-plan`
- **Vision**: Automate the extraction of blog-worthy insights from development work
- **Input Sources**: Journal entries, git commit messages, development artifacts
- **Output**: Tagged, categorized blog content suggestions with quality scoring

## Key Functional Requirements
- Analyze journal entries for blog-worthy insights and learning moments
- Process git commit messages to identify technical decisions and milestones
- Apply automatic tagging (technical, business, learning, stakeholder categories)
- Generate structured blog schema compatible with future Convex integration
- Handle duplicate insights across multiple sources
- Quality scoring for blog potential assessment

## Technical Architecture Concepts
- **BlogPost Entity**: Title, content, tags, publication status, source attribution
- **ContentSource Entity**: Origin tracking with metadata and extraction timestamps
- **Tag Hierarchy**: Nested categorization (technical.frontend, business.stakeholder)
- **Insight Entity**: Extracted content with confidence scores and positioning suggestions
- **ContentAnalysis**: Processing results with quality metrics

## Clarifications Needed
- Content privacy and filtering rules for sensitive information
- Blog publication workflow (drafts vs published vs suggestions)
- Tag taxonomy and categorization rules
- Deduplication strategies for similar insights

## Real-World Evolution
While the spec called for automated content extraction and mock data, we pivoted to implementing a complete manual blog system immediately. This provided instant value for sharing development insights rather than waiting for the full automated pipeline.

## Business Value
This spec identified the core need for transforming development work into shareable content. The vision of automated content analytics remains valuable for future development, but manual blog creation solved the immediate need to document and share our development journey.

## Future Potential
- AI-powered content extraction from development artifacts
- Automated tagging and categorization of insights
- Integration with development tools for seamless content flow
- Quality scoring algorithms for content recommendation
