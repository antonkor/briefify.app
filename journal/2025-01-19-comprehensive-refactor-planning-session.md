```typescript
// Error boundary implementation planned
interface ErrorInfo {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  message: string;
  context: ErrorContext;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
}

// Performance monitoring structure
interface PerformanceMetric {
  name: string;
  value: number;
  threshold?: number;
  passed: boolean;
}
```
