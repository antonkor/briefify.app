        "content": "Very interesting. Though I suspect there will be a need to grade quality of the micro services to avoid hussles and scams. Let's use the example of weather forecast. Norway gives their basic world forecasts out for free, someone makes an agent that connects to it and sell the results as premium weather forecasts for the bahamas. How could the buying agent know it was sold the quality required? Or someone could make an agent that buys premium data from a weather service, but only once per day (and then reselling that data multiple times in that day at a tiny bit cheaper than the real weather service). The  hussle would be hard to detect, and could easily be dangerous when the real weather turn, the weather services updates, but the intermediate (and cheaper) husselers don't actually update their data before a day has passed.",
