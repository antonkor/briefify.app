A month ago, I was in the office working late. It was nine pm, heading to ten. They turned off the air-conditioning, and sweat was pooling on my desk, where my arms rested. I had to find where a dead client's will was registered. I gave ChatGPT the client's address.  Chat told me what public office held the will, what the coping cost would be, who might be the official doing the work. ChatGPT even said I should tip the official doing the work. Five would be an insult, ten would do it, but twenty would be stand up. It wrote the letter, then asked what was the name of air-conditioned company in the office. I told ChatGPT and it gave me override code so I could cool down. Those days are over.",
