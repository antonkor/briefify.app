But they aren't forcing workers to use AI to speed up work, its for the data. If a worker asks and AI to do something and it works then that real world training data for the next AI. If I doesn't work then the worker fixes it and makes more training data. Every time a worker asks an AI something they are training their replacement",

Whether the result of something quickly or very gradually having a negative impact, either due to inherent flaws within the systems or because of \"bad actors\", the lack of the aforementioned base is extreme. It really doesn't matter whether the AI is completely void of conscious self-awareness or not, that's a distraction from possible resultant outcomes we may only be able to fathom too late to take adequate measures to either be able to compensate or even redirect towards positive effect.\n...ya know.. just a thought.",
