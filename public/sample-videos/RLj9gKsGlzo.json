I often switch around models for different tasks but I find myself using gtp 5 more.. not sure if this has anything to do with it but gpt 5 has been kicking ass with one shot implementing, especially with contract contexts it can refer to.",

How do you do that ?\nAsk the tool to help your articulate the problem.\n\nStep 2 : Add coding axioms to the personality so it thinks like a developer : Functional  , Understandable , Maintainable , Expandable.   The secret concept is to have the llm list the idea instructions to recreate the code in the header as comments. It improves output and components going missing in the next output response.\n\nAdv Step : Ask for ontology sets. You ask for the ontology of the domain first and then a subset primary set of that domain.  You derive connections or ask the tool to do this part as well.",
