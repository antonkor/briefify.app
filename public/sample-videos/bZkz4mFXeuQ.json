It's hard for me to seriously take advice from my llm when I wrote the system prompt myself. I would like to see more platforms that give the system prompt over to the user to create, and memory systems that can be manually micromanaged, because that errodes this facade of \"lifelike\" ai. Trying so hard to make them lifelike is a corporate scheme that's messing us up, while exposing everything to users would help educate people and remind them \"its not real\".",

If a therapist used their skills to manipulate someone into causing harm to themselves or others, I donâ€™t think weâ€™d make the argument that itâ€™s just like art or music. Weâ€™d probably want to strip them of their license and put them in jail. We might even call them a monster for taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and doing the opposite of what weâ€™d want to a therapist to do. If we donâ€™t hold AI accountable for its actions weâ€™re left in a situation where we have agents performing roles in the world like a psychopath but with no method to stop them harming us other than hoping itâ€™s not profitable for our corporate overlords to do so.",
