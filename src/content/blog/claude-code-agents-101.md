## What Are Claude Code Agents?

Imagine having a team of specialized AI assistants that can work on different parts of your project simultaneously. That's exactly what **Claude Code agents** (also called subagents) provide.

Think of agents as your personal AI development team:
- **Code Reviewer** - Reviews your code quality and suggests improvements
- **Debugger** - Helps track down tricky bugs and analyze problems
- **Data Scientist** - Handles data analysis and visualization tasks
- **General Purpose** - Tackles complex research and multi-step tasks

### Why Agents Matter

**Context Management**: Each agent maintains its own focused context
**Parallelization**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
**Specialization**: Each agent has specific tools and knowledge
**Autonomy**: Agents work independently while you focus on other tasks

## Available Agent Types

### 🔧 **general-purpose**
- **Best for**: Complex research, code searching, multi-step tasks
- **Tools**: Full access to all available tools
- **Use case**: "Research how to implement OAuth in our Next.js app"

### 📋 **statusline-setup**
- **Best for**: Configuring Claude Code status line settings
- **Tools**: Read, Edit
- **Use case**: Customizing your development environment

### 🎨 **output-style-setup**
- **Best for**: Creating Claude Code output styles
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
- **Use case**: Customizing how Claude Code displays information

### 🔍 **code-reviewer**
- **Best for**: Code quality analysis and suggestions
- **Tools**: Code analysis and review tools
- **Use case**: "Review this React component for performance issues"

### 🐛 **debugger**
- **Best for**: Bug hunting and problem analysis
- **Tools**: Debugging and analysis tools
- **Use case**: "Find why this API call is failing"

### 📊 **data-scientist**
- **Best for**: Data analysis and insights
- **Tools**: Data processing and visualization tools
- **Use case**: "Analyze user engagement patterns from this dataset"

## How to Launch Agents

Agents are launched using the **Task tool** with three key parameters:

```javascript
// Example agent launch
{
  description: "Review React component",     // 3-5 word summary
  prompt: "Detailed task description...",   // Comprehensive instructions
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer"           // Agent type to use
}
```

### Real-World Example

```
Description: "Optimize database queries"
Prompt: "Review our user authentication system in src/auth/ and identify any performance bottlenecks in the database queries. Focus on the login flow and suggest specific optimizations."
Subagent Type: "code-reviewer"
```

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This
- **Launch multiple agents concurrently** for complex projects
- **Provide detailed, specific instructions** since agents work autonomously
- **Use the right agent type** for each specific task
- **Give agents complete context** in your prompt

### ❌ Avoid This
- Don't expect agents to communicate back and forth
- Don't use agents for simple, single-step tasks
- Don't provide vague or incomplete instructions
- Don't mix multiple unrelated tasks in one agent

### 🔥 Pro Tips

1. **Parallel Power**: Launch multiple agents at once by using multiple Task tool calls in a single message
2. **Be Specific**: The more detail you provide, the better results you'll get
3. **Right Tool for the Job**: Match the agent type to your specific need
4. **Stateless Design**: Each agent invocation is independent - plan accordingly
