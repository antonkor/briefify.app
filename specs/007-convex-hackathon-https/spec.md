# Feature Specification: Convex Hackathon Brief Insights App

**Feature Branch**: `007-convex-hackathon-https`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "convex hackathon - https://www.convex.dev/hackathons/modernstack make a plan to enter and win this competition in 3rd place. i want to make a app that collects brief insights on insterests you follow. i want to use convex for serverless data. for prototyping i want to use claude code, mockup data, but later i want to use apify scheduled actors to retrieve info. if we have tim i would like to migrate to firecrawl but im familiar with apify actors so for phase 2 i want to use that. document what are some important steps we need to follow through with to get a better chance of winning"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Brief insights collection app for Convex Hackathon
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Users, content sources, insights
   ’ Actions: Follow interests, collect insights, view summaries
   ’ Data: User preferences, content feeds, processed insights
   ’ Constraints: Hackathon timeline (Sept 16 - Oct 1), 3rd place target
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What types of interests/content sources?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How frequently should insights be updated?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: User follows interests ’ receives brief insights
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement testable and hackathon-aligned
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Users, Interests, Content Sources, Insights, Subscriptions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Focus on hackathon judging criteria alignment
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for hackathon development)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A busy professional wants to stay informed about their interests (tech trends, industry news, hobbies) without spending hours browsing multiple sources. They follow specific topics and receive daily AI-generated brief insights summarizing the most important developments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the app, **When** they sign up and select interests to follow, **Then** they receive personalized insight briefs within 24 hours
2. **Given** a user has active subscriptions, **When** new content is available from their followed interests, **Then** insights are automatically generated and delivered to their dashboard
3. **Given** a user wants to explore new topics, **When** they browse available interest categories, **Then** they can preview sample insights before subscribing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no new content is available for a followed interest?
- How does the system handle rate limits from content sources?
- What occurs when AI insight generation fails?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create accounts and authenticate securely
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to browse and follow specific interest categories [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: predefined categories vs. custom topics?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST collect content from external sources for followed interests
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate AI-powered brief insights from collected content daily
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to view their personalized insight dashboard
- **FR-006**: System MUST store user preferences and reading history in Convex database
- **FR-007**: System MUST support real-time updates for new insights
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to manage their followed interests (add/remove)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide export functionality for insights [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what formats needed?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle content source failures gracefully

### Key Entities
- **User**: Account holder with authentication, preferences, and subscription history
- **Interest**: Topic or category that users can follow (e.g., "AI Development", "Climate Tech")
- **Content Source**: External data provider (initially mockup, later Apify actors, potentially Firecrawl)
- **Insight**: AI-generated brief summary of content for a specific interest and time period
- **Subscription**: Relationship between user and interest with status and settings

## Hackathon Development Phases

### Phase 1: Prototype (Days 1-7)
- **Goal**: Working MVP with mockup data
- **Key Features**: User auth, interest selection, basic insights display
- **Tech Stack**: Convex + Next.js + mockup data
- **Success Metric**: Functional demo with realistic data

### Phase 2: Content Integration (Days 8-11)
- **Goal**: Real content collection via Apify actors
- **Key Features**: Scheduled content fetching, AI insight generation
- **Integration**: Apify scheduled actors + OpenAI/Claude for insights
- **Success Metric**: Real insights from actual content sources

### Phase 3: Polish & Demo (Days 12-13)
- **Goal**: Production-ready app with compelling demo video
- **Key Features**: UI polish, error handling, performance optimization
- **Deliverables**: Video demo, GitHub repo, deployed app
- **Success Metric**: Professional presentation showcasing technical depth

### Optional: Firecrawl Migration
- **Condition**: If ahead of schedule in Phase 2
- **Goal**: Demonstrate multiple sponsor integrations
- **Benefit**: Higher integration score from judges
