# Feature Specification: Theme Engine System

**Feature Branch**: `010-theme-engine-ideation`
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "theme-engine ideation: i'd like to give users the ability to easily change themes. i want there to be many themes. for now. lets make 3.dark, light, and give this one a name: [Image #1] and descrption so the theme engine can do its thing later. focus on specing out the theme-engine mostly and then outline some theme schema including the 3 themes we can have"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature involves expanding current 2-theme system to multi-theme engine
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Users who want to customize appearance
   ’ Actions: Theme selection, theme switching, theme persistence
   ’ Data: Theme configurations, user preferences
   ’ Constraints: Multiple theme support, extensible system
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ None identified - requirements are clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: User selects and applies themes
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Theme engine, theme registry, UI controls, persistence
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Theme definitions, theme metadata, user preferences
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec ready for planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users want to personalize their application experience by selecting from multiple visual themes that change the overall appearance, colors, and styling of the interface. They expect their theme choice to persist across sessions and be easily switchable through an intuitive interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the application, **When** they access the theme selector, **Then** they see all available themes with preview indicators
2. **Given** a user selects a new theme, **When** they confirm their choice, **Then** the entire application interface immediately updates to reflect the new theme
3. **Given** a user has selected a theme, **When** they reload the page or return later, **Then** their chosen theme is automatically applied
4. **Given** a user wants to compare themes, **When** they hover over theme options, **Then** they see a preview or description of each theme
5. **Given** the application has multiple themes, **When** new themes are added, **Then** users can access them without any code changes required

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a previously selected theme is no longer available?
- How does the system handle incomplete theme definitions?
- What is the fallback behavior if theme loading fails?
- How does the system perform when switching between themes rapidly?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a theme selection interface accessible to all users
- **FR-002**: System MUST support at least three distinct themes: Light, Dark, and Developer
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to switch between themes with immediate visual feedback
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist user theme preferences across browser sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply theme changes to all application components consistently
- **FR-006**: Theme engine MUST support extensible theme definitions for future additions
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide theme preview capabilities before final selection
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle theme loading failures gracefully with fallback options
- **FR-009**: Theme selector MUST be accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate theme integrity before application

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Theme Definition**: Represents a complete visual style package including colors, typography, spacing, and component styling rules
- **Theme Registry**: Central repository that manages available themes and their metadata
- **User Theme Preference**: Stores individual user's selected theme choice and related preferences
- **Theme Metadata**: Contains theme information including name, description, preview data, and compatibility information

### Theme Schema Definitions

#### Light Theme
- **Name**: "Light"
- **Description**: "Clean, bright interface optimized for daytime use with high contrast and minimal eye strain"
- **Characteristics**: White/light gray backgrounds, dark text, blue accent colors, subtle shadows

#### Dark Theme
- **Name**: "Dark"

- **Characteristics**: Dark gray/black backgrounds, light text, muted accent colors, reduced brightness

#### Developer Theme
- **Name**: "Developer"
- **Description**: "Terminal-inspired theme with syntax highlighting colors, perfect for developers and technical users"
- **Characteristics**: Black backgrounds, green/red/amber text colors, monospace font preferences, high contrast error states
