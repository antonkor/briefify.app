# Feature Specification: YouTube URL Ingest & Processing System

**Feature Branch**: `001-youtube-ingest-system`
**Created**: September 18, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "look at @plan.md and do your thing creating specs for every major feature here"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Analyzed plan.md for comprehensive feature breakdown
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: URL ingestion, transcript/comment processing, summary generation, mobile UI, analytics
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary flow: URL input � processing � summary generation � results display
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement focuses on user value and testable outcomes
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Videos, transcripts, comments, summaries, preferences, events
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Focused on business requirements without technical implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user discovers an interesting YouTube video and wants to quickly understand its key points and community reaction without watching the entire video or scrolling through hundreds of comments. They paste the YouTube URL into Briefify, which automatically fetches the video's transcript and comments, then generates multiple summary formats (bullet points, paragraphs, sentiment analysis, Q&A) that they can read in under a minute. The user can save these summaries for later reference and optionally set up automated summaries for future videos from the same channel.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a YouTube URL, **When** they paste it and click "Generate Summary", **Then** the system processes the video and displays metadata, transcript, comments, and generated summaries within 20 seconds
2. **Given** the system has processed a video, **When** the user selects different summary templates (Bullet Highlights, Concise Paragraph, Sentiment Pulse, Q&A Snapshot), **Then** each template displays relevant content instantly
3. **Given** a processed video, **When** the user opens "Mock Email Preview", **Then** they see a formatted email containing the selected summary ready for potential delivery
4. **Given** multiple processed videos, **When** the user accesses History, **Then** they can view and revisit all previously processed videos with their summaries
5. **Given** a user wants regular updates, **When** they set scheduling preferences (daily/weekly/monthly), **Then** the system stores their preferences for future automation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a YouTube URL has no available transcript?
- How does the system handle videos with disabled comments?
- What occurs when a user submits an invalid or private YouTube URL?
- How does the system respond when external services (transcript/comment fetching) are temporarily unavailable?
- What happens with very long videos (3+ hours) or videos with thousands of comments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept YouTube URLs in both short (youtu.be) and long (youtube.com/watch) formats
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate YouTube URLs and provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
- **FR-003**: System MUST fetch video metadata including title, channel name, publication date, and duration
- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve video transcripts when available and handle cases where transcripts are unavailable
- **FR-005**: System MUST collect sample comments (up to 100) including author, text, likes, and timestamps
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate four distinct summary templates: Bullet Highlights (5-8 key points), Concise Paragraph (3-5 sentences), Sentiment Pulse (community reaction analysis), and Q&A Snapshot (3 question-answer pairs)
- **FR-007**: System MUST display processing status with clear progress indicators during URL ingestion
- **FR-008**: System MUST store processed videos and summaries for user history and future reference
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide mobile-first responsive interface optimized for touch interaction
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to preview generated summaries in mock email format
- **FR-011**: System MUST enable users to set scheduling preferences (none, daily, weekly, monthly) for future automation
- **FR-012**: System MUST track user interactions and system performance through analytics events
- **FR-013**: System MUST complete full processing workflow (URL to summary) within 30 seconds for typical videos
- **FR-014**: System MUST gracefully degrade functionality when partial data is unavailable (e.g., comments disabled)
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear empty states and error recovery options

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Video**: Represents a YouTube video with metadata (title, channel, duration, publication date), processing status, and unique identifier
- **Transcript**: Contains video transcript text, language information, and optional timestamped segments for searchability
- **Comments**: Collection of video comments including author information, text content, engagement metrics (likes, replies), and publication timestamps
- **Summary**: Generated content for each template type (bullets, paragraph, sentiment, Q&A) associated with specific videos and creation timestamps
- **Preferences**: User settings for scheduling frequency and delivery channel preferences (email, SMS, Discord) with contact information
- **Events**: Analytics tracking for user interactions, system performance, and feature usage patterns
