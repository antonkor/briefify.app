# Feature Specification: Vibe Mode Quick Inspect

**Feature Branch**: `019-vibe-mode-quick`
**Created**: September 20, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "vibe mode quick inspect. when vibe mode is on show little round icon over each element to show a popup with quick dev refrences without having to open chrome inspect dev tools. just provide minimal insights for now and put coming sooon in a label list (later we can add feedback loop RL posthog custom actions and features and convex insights and serverless functionality.. much  later  we can build eye tracking software when you turn on a vibe mode subsettings appear for things to include into on the quick inspect popup (settings found in vibe mode sub settings)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or power user, when I enable "Vibe Mode", I want to see interactive inspection icons overlaid on UI elements so I can quickly access development insights without opening browser dev tools. This enables rapid prototyping, debugging, and understanding of component structure during development workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Vibe Mode is enabled, **When** I hover over any UI element, **Then** a small round inspection icon appears near the element
2. **Given** an inspection icon is visible, **When** I click the icon, **Then** a popup displays with quick development references for that element
3. **Given** the inspection popup is open, **When** I view the popup content, **Then** I see minimal insights and a "Coming Soon" label list for future features
4. **Given** Vibe Mode is disabled, **When** I interact with UI elements, **Then** no inspection icons or popups appear

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple elements overlap and have inspection icons?
- How does the system handle inspection of dynamically generated elements?
- What occurs when the inspection popup would appear outside viewport boundaries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display small round inspection icons when Vibe Mode is enabled
- **FR-002**: System MUST show inspection icons on hover over interactive UI elements
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a popup with development insights when inspection icon is clicked
- **FR-004**: Popup MUST contain minimal development insights relevant to the inspected element
- **FR-005**: Popup MUST include a "Coming Soon" label list for future planned features
- **FR-006**: System MUST hide all inspection icons and popups when Vibe Mode is disabled
- **FR-007**: Inspection icons MUST be positioned to avoid interfering with normal UI interactions
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle multiple inspection icons simultaneously without visual conflicts
- **FR-009**: Popup MUST close when user clicks outside the popup area or presses escape key
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide visual feedback when hovering over inspection icons

### Future Expansion Requirements
- **FR-011**: System MUST support sub-settings within Vibe Mode for customizing inspection popup content [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific sub-settings not defined]
- **FR-012**: Architecture MUST accommodate future integration with analytics and feedback systems
- **FR-013**: System MUST be extensible for future eye tracking integration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: eye tracking requirements and scope undefined]

### Key Entities
- **Inspection Icon**: Visual indicator overlaid on UI elements, displays development insights popup when activated
- **Development Popup**: Modal container displaying quick development references and coming soon features
- **Vibe Mode State**: Global application state controlling visibility and behavior of inspection features
- **UI Element Reference**: Association between DOM elements and their corresponding development metadata
- **Coming Soon Labels**: List of planned features displayed in inspection popup for future reference
