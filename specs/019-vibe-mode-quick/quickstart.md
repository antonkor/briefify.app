# Quickstart: Vibe Mode Quick Inspect

**Feature**: 019-vibe-mode-quick
**Date**: September 20, 2025
**Prerequisites**: Development environment with Next.js application running

## Overview

This quickstart guide walks through implementing and testing the Vibe Mode Quick Inspect feature. The feature adds interactive inspection icons to UI elements when Vibe Mode is enabled, providing developers with quick access to component insights without opening browser dev tools.

## User Story Validation

### Primary User Story
*As a developer or power user, when I enable "Vibe Mode", I want to see interactive inspection icons overlaid on UI elements so I can quickly access development insights without opening browser dev tools.*

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enable Vibe Mode
1. **Navigate** to the Briefify application homepage
2. **Locate** the workshop controls in the bottom-right corner
3. **Click** the wrench icon to open workshop mode
4. **Toggle** "Vibe Mode" switch to ON
5. **Verify** the toggle shows as enabled (blue background)

**Expected Result**: Vibe Mode is enabled and ready for inspection

### Step 2: Basic Inspection Icon Display
1. **With Vibe Mode enabled**, hover over any UI element (button, card, input field)
2. **Observe** that a small round inspection icon appears near the element
3. **Move mouse** to different elements and verify icons appear/disappear appropriately
4. **Hover** over complex components like the video input form or video cards

**Expected Result**:
- Inspection icons appear on hover over UI elements
- Icons are positioned to avoid interfering with normal UI
- Icons disappear when mouse leaves the element

### Step 3: Inspection Popup Functionality
1. **Hover** over a UI element to show the inspection icon
2. **Click** the inspection icon
3. **Verify** that a popup appears with development insights
4. **Check** popup content includes:
   - Element tag name and basic attributes
   - CSS classes (especially Tailwind classes if present)
   - Component name (if React component detected)
   - "Coming Soon" section with future features

**Expected Result**:
- Popup displays near the clicked element
- Content is readable and well-formatted
- Popup doesn't extend outside viewport

### Step 4: Popup Interaction and Dismissal
1. **With popup open**, click outside the popup area
2. **Verify** popup closes
3. **Open another popup** by clicking a different inspection icon
4. **Press Escape key** while popup is open
5. **Verify** popup closes with Escape key

**Expected Result**:
- Popup closes when clicking outside
- Popup closes with Escape key
- Only one popup is open at a time

### Step 5: Multiple Element Inspection
1. **Hover** over multiple elements quickly in succession
2. **Verify** icons appear and disappear smoothly without performance issues
3. **Click** inspection icons on different types of elements:
   - Text elements (headings, paragraphs)
   - Interactive elements (buttons, inputs)
   - Container elements (divs, sections)
   - Complex components (video cards, forms)

**Expected Result**:
- Smooth performance with multiple rapid hovers
- Different elements show appropriate inspection data
- No visual conflicts between multiple icons

### Step 6: Vibe Mode Disable
1. **Return** to workshop controls
2. **Toggle** "Vibe Mode" to OFF
3. **Hover** over UI elements
4. **Verify** no inspection icons appear
5. **Confirm** normal UI interactions work without interference

**Expected Result**:
- No inspection icons appear when Vibe Mode is disabled
- Normal UI functionality is unaffected
- Toggle state persists correctly

## Edge Case Testing

### Edge Case 1: Viewport Boundary Handling
1. **Navigate** to an element near the edge of the viewport
2. **Hover** and click the inspection icon
3. **Verify** popup repositions to stay within viewport bounds

**Expected Result**: Popup adjusts position to remain fully visible

### Edge Case 2: Overlapping Elements
1. **Find** elements that overlap or are closely positioned
2. **Hover** over these elements
3. **Verify** inspection icons don't conflict visually

**Expected Result**: Icons position correctly without overlap conflicts

### Edge Case 3: Dynamic Content
1. **Trigger** any dynamic content changes (e.g., loading states, form submissions)
2. **Hover** over newly created elements
3. **Verify** inspection works on dynamically generated content

**Expected Result**: Inspection works on all elements regardless of creation time

## Performance Validation

### Performance Check 1: Hover Response Time
1. **Hover** over various elements
2. **Measure** time from hover to icon appearance (should be < 100ms)
3. **Verify** no noticeable lag in icon display

**Expected Result**: Icons appear quickly and responsively

### Performance Check 2: Analysis Speed
1. **Click** inspection icons on complex components
2. **Measure** time from click to popup display (should be < 200ms for basic analysis)
3. **Monitor** browser dev tools for any performance warnings

**Expected Result**: Popups appear quickly without performance degradation

### Performance Check 3: Memory Usage
1. **Inspect multiple elements** (at least 10 different ones)
2. **Check** browser dev tools Memory tab
3. **Verify** no significant memory leaks

**Expected Result**: Memory usage remains stable

## Accessibility Validation

### Accessibility Check 1: Keyboard Navigation
1. **Use only keyboard** to navigate the application
2. **Verify** inspection popups can be closed with Escape key
3. **Ensure** inspection doesn't trap keyboard focus

**Expected Result**: Keyboard accessibility is maintained

### Accessibility Check 2: Screen Reader Compatibility
1. **Test with screen reader** if available
2. **Verify** inspection icons don't interfere with screen reader navigation
3. **Ensure** popup content is accessible to assistive technologies

**Expected Result**: Feature doesn't break accessibility
