## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user discovers workshop mode in Briefify and wants to explore the application's features while providing meaningful feedback to help improve the product. They activate workshop mode, which presents a structured walkthrough of the video analysis process with manual stage navigation controls. At each stage, they can provide instant feedback via thumbs up/down buttons, and their interactions are captured for product analytics. This creates a collaborative improvement cycle where user feedback directly informs product development decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user activates workshop mode, **When** they navigate through analysis stages, **Then** they can provide feedback at each stage via clearly visible thumbs up/down buttons
2. **Given** workshop mode is active, **When** the user interacts with stage navigation controls, **Then** their usage patterns are tracked via PostHog analytics for product optimization
3. **Given** feedback is provided on any stage, **When** the interaction occurs, **Then** the feedback is immediately captured with contextual metadata (stage, timestamp, user session)
4. **Given** multiple users provide feedback over time, **When** product team reviews analytics, **Then** aggregated feedback patterns inform feature prioritization and UX improvements
5. **Given** a user completes a workshop session, **When** they finish the experience, **Then** their overall session data is available for analysis while maintaining user privacy

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users provide conflicting feedback (thumbs up and down rapidly)?
- How does the system handle users who activate workshop mode but don't provide any feedback?
- What occurs when PostHog analytics service is unavailable during a feedback session?
- How does the interface handle users with accessibility needs who use screen readers or keyboard navigation?
- What happens when users abandon workshop mode mid-session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Workshop Mode Functionality
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a workshop mode toggle that users can activate to enter guided experience mode
- **FR-002**: Workshop mode MUST allow manual navigation through all video analysis stages (idle, fetching, hero, insights, comments, complete)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display previous/next stage controls with clear visual feedback for stage transitions
- **FR-004**: Workshop mode MUST provide a reset function to return to the initial state for repeated testing

#### Feedback Collection System
- **FR-006**: System MUST display thumbs up and thumbs down buttons prominently above workshop mode controls
- **FR-007**: Feedback buttons MUST be accessible at all times during workshop mode sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST capture feedback with contextual metadata including current stage, timestamp, and session identifier
- **FR-009**: Feedback interactions MUST provide immediate visual confirmation when thumbs up/down is selected
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to change their feedback (from thumbs up to thumbs down or vice versa) within the same session

#### Analytics Integration - PostHog
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with PostHog analytics to capture all workshop mode interactions
- **FR-012**: Each stage navigation action MUST trigger a PostHog custom event with stage context
- **FR-013**: Feedback submissions (thumbs up/down) MUST be tracked as PostHog events with sentiment and stage data
- **FR-014**: Workshop session start/end MUST be recorded as PostHog events for session analysis
- **FR-015**: User engagement metrics MUST be captured including time spent per stage and overall session duration

#### Analytics Integration - Google Analytics
- **FR-016**: System MUST send workshop mode activation events to Google Analytics for traffic analysis
- **FR-017**: Stage progression events MUST be tracked in Google Analytics as user journey milestones
- **FR-018**: Feedback events MUST be sent to Google Analytics with appropriate event categories and labels
- **FR-019**: Session completion rates MUST be measurable through Google Analytics goal tracking

#### Advanced Feedback Loop Design

- **FeedbackLoop**: Strategic feedback collection point designed for specific user experience optimization with placement context and response tracking
- **UserFeedbackProfile**: Aggregated user feedback behavior including participation rate, sentiment patterns, and engagement preferences for personalization

## Advanced Feedback Loop Strategy *(expanded section)*

### Intelligent Feedback Placement
The system should implement thoughtfully placed feedback opportunities that enhance rather than interrupt the user experience:

#### Primary Feedback Touchpoints
- **Post-Analysis Completion**: Immediate thumbs up/down after video processing completes
- **Insight Discovery**: Micro-feedback on individual insights ("Was this insight helpful?")
- **Navigation Efficiency**: Feedback on ease of finding desired information
- **Loading Experience**: User satisfaction with processing time and progress indicators
- **Mobile Experience**: Specific feedback on mobile usability and touch interactions

#### Contextual Feedback Triggers
- **First-Time User Journey**: Enhanced feedback collection for onboarding optimization
- **Feature Discovery**: Feedback when users discover new features (workshop mode, advanced filtering)
- **Error Recovery**: User sentiment tracking after error states or failed operations
- **Performance Perception**: Feedback correlation with actual loading times and user satisfaction
- **Content Quality**: User assessment of AI-generated summaries and insights accuracy

#### Feedback Loop Optimization
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with minimal feedback requests and increase based on user engagement
- **Timing Intelligence**: Optimal moments for feedback requests based on user flow analysis
- **Sentiment Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of user satisfaction trends and intervention triggers
- **Feedback Fatigue Prevention**: Smart throttling to prevent overwhelming engaged users
- **Response-Driven Iteration**: Rapid product improvements based on feedback pattern analysis

### Analytics Event Architecture

#### PostHog Custom Events
- **workshop_mode_activated**: User enters workshop mode with device and context metadata
- **workshop_stage_navigated**: Stage transitions with direction (next/previous) and timing data
- **workshop_feedback_submitted**: Thumbs up/down with stage context and sentiment value
- **workshop_session_completed**: Full session completion with duration and engagement metrics
- **micro_feedback_interaction**: Contextual feedback throughout normal app usage
- **feature_discovery_event**: User discovers and interacts with new features
- **error_recovery_feedback**: User sentiment after encountering and resolving errors

#### Google Analytics Integration
- **Event Category**: Workshop Mode, User Feedback, Feature Engagement
- **Event Actions**: Stage Navigation, Feedback Submission, Session Completion
- **Event Labels**: Specific stage names, feedback sentiment, user journey context
- **Custom Dimensions**: User type (new/returning), device category, session characteristics
- **Goal Conversion**: Workshop completion, positive feedback submission, feature adoption
