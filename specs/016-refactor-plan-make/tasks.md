# Tasks: Comprehensive Application Refactor Plan

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/016-refactor-plan-make/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (refactor requirements)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load spec.md from feature directory
   → Extract: 5 priority areas, 20 functional requirements
2. Generate tasks by improvement area:
   → File System Conflicts (FR-001 to FR-004)
   → Performance & Optimization (FR-005 to FR-008)
   → Error Handling (FR-009 to FR-012)
   → Architecture (FR-013 to FR-016)
   → Developer Experience (FR-017 to FR-020)
3. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Critical fixes before enhancements
   → Documentation alongside implementation
4. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
5. Generate dependency graph
6. Create parallel execution examples
7. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

- [ ] T025 [P] Add JSDoc comments to all exported functions

## Phase 3.6: Developer Experience
- [ ] T026 [P] Create comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] T027 [P] Add CONTRIBUTING.md with code style guidelines
- [ ] T028 [P] Create docs/common-issues.md with solutions
- [ ] T029 Setup pre-commit hooks for linting in .husky/
- [ ] T030 [P] Add npm scripts for common development tasks

## Phase 3.7: Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] T031 [P] Setup Jest configuration in jest.config.js
- [ ] T032 [P] Create src/components/__tests__/ directory structure
- [ ] T033 [P] Write unit tests for VideoInputForm component
- [ ] T034 [P] Write unit tests for mock data loading utilities
- [ ] T035 Add integration test for full user journey

## Phase 3.8: Polish & Documentation
- [ ] T036 [P] Update all package dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] T037 Remove unused dependencies from package.json
- [ ] T038 [P] Create docs/architecture.md with system overview
- [ ] T039 [P] Add inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] T040 Run full audit and fix any security vulnerabilities

## Dependencies
- Environment fixes (T001-T005) must complete first
- Build improvements (T006-T010) before performance work
- Error handling (T011-T015) can run parallel with performance
- Architecture (T021-T025) before testing setup
- Documentation can run parallel with most tasks

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Critical Fixes (Run Together):
```bash
Task: "Add .next to .gitignore"
Task: "Create scripts/clean-build.ps1 for Windows"
Task: "Create scripts/clean-build.sh for Unix"
```

### Error Handling Components (Run Together):
```bash
Task: "Add error boundary to src/app/layout.tsx"
Task: "Create src/components/ErrorFallback.tsx"
Task: "Create src/utils/logger.ts for centralized logging"
```

### Documentation Sprint (Run Together):
```bash
Task: "Create comprehensive README.md"
Task: "Add CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines"
Task: "Create docs/common-issues.md"
Task: "Create docs/architecture.md"
```

## Success Metrics
- Zero OneDrive-related build errors
- Dev server starts in <10 seconds
- No runtime crashes from missing data
- All components have error boundaries
- 80% code coverage with tests

## Notes
- Priority 1: Fix environment issues (T001-T005)
- Priority 2: Stabilize build system (T006-T010)
- Priority 3: Add resilience (T011-T015)
- Run documentation tasks in parallel with code changes
- Commit after each completed task group

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All functional requirements addressed
- [x] Critical fixes prioritized first
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Documentation tasks included
