## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need to understand the legal terms governing their use of briefify.app and how their personal data is handled, including disclosure of third-party tools and services used by the platform.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the briefify.app website, **When** they click on "Terms of Use" link, **Then** they see a clear, concise terms of use page
2. **Given** a user is on the briefify.app website, **When** they click on "Privacy Policy" link, **Then** they see a privacy policy that lists all tools and services used
3. **Given** a user is reading the privacy policy, **When** they review the "Third-Party Services" section, **Then** they see Google Analytics and any other tools disclosed
4. **Given** a new user is signing up, **When** they complete registration, **Then** they must acknowledge they've read the terms and privacy policy

### Edge Cases

- How does system handle users who haven't agreed to updated terms?
