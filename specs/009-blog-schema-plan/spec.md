# Feature Specification: Blog Content Analytics System

**Feature Branch**: `009-blog-schema-plan`
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "blog schema plan: take journal entries and commit messages and find interesting bits to blog about with tags. create mock.json for now and when we do convex integration we'll have boilerplats."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature extracted: Blog content analytics and tagging system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Content creators, blog readers
   ’ Actions: Extract insights, tag content, generate blog posts
   ’ Data: Journal entries, commit messages, blog metadata
   ’ Constraints: Mock data initially, Convex integration later
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Blog publication workflow not specified]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Tag taxonomy and categorization rules]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Analyze development content ’ Generate blog-ready insights
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Content analysis, tagging, mock data generation
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ BlogPost, ContentSource, Tag, Insight
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties around publication workflow"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A content creator working on Briefify wants to transform their development journey (captured in journal entries and git commits) into engaging blog content. They need a system that automatically analyzes their development artifacts, identifies interesting insights, applies relevant tags, and presents blog-worthy content suggestions. This enables them to share their technical journey with the community while building thought leadership around their product development process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** journal entries exist in the system, **When** the content analysis runs, **Then** interesting insights are extracted and tagged with relevant categories (e.g., "technical-decision", "learning", "stakeholder-insight")
2. **Given** commit messages contain meaningful development context, **When** processed by the system, **Then** they are analyzed for blog-worthy content and tagged appropriately
3. **Given** tagged insights are available, **When** a user requests blog content suggestions, **Then** the system presents organized, categorized insights ready for blog post development
4. **Given** the system is in development phase, **When** mock data is needed, **Then** realistic sample blog content with proper schema structure is available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when journal entries contain sensitive or proprietary information?
- How does system handle commit messages with minimal or unclear content?
- What occurs when the same insight appears across multiple sources (journal + commits)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze journal entries to extract blog-worthy insights and key learning moments
- **FR-002**: System MUST process git commit messages to identify interesting development decisions and technical milestones
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically apply relevant tags to categorize content (e.g., technical, business, learning, stakeholder)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a structured schema for blog content that includes metadata, tags, and source attribution
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate mock JSON data representing realistic blog content during development phase
- **FR-006**: System MUST prepare schema structure compatible with future Convex database integration
- **FR-007**: System MUST identify and highlight insights with high blog potential based on content quality and uniqueness
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle duplicate or similar insights across different content sources
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Content privacy and filtering rules not specified - how to handle sensitive information?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Blog publication workflow not defined - is this for drafts, published posts, or content suggestions?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **BlogPost**: Represents a potential or actual blog article with title, content, tags, publication status, and source attribution
- **ContentSource**: Represents origin of blog insights (journal entry, commit message, development artifact) with metadata and extraction timestamp
- **Tag**: Categorization label with hierarchy support (technical.frontend, business.stakeholder, learning.debugging)
- **Insight**: Extracted piece of blog-worthy content with confidence score, source reference, and suggested positioning
- **ContentAnalysis**: Processing result containing extracted insights, applied tags, and quality metrics for blog potential
