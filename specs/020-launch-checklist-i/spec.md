# Feature Specification: Launch Checklist & Blog System

**Feature Branch**: `020-launch-checklist-i`
**Created**: September 20, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "launch checklist: i want to have a daily quest checkpoints for what i need to complete each day before the cut off. i should already have a blog with 4-10 posts ready to schedule. i need to still learn to make graphics that match my theme for hero bgs, featured image that is used as a pane header. i need to build a menu to read blog, i need to come up with a name/theme for this blog. like brief recaps or something. make blog posts todo with what im working on and doing from /logs, /journals, and /specs. but dont reavel anything that might hurt our brand or personal brand or me. but i do want to make many of the things i do into tutorials and eventually it would make tutorials ahead for me to expand the app where people can read journal entries . for now lets keep it simple and make schema for the blog. and then a minimal blog layout following the other panes we have so this thing feels like panes of glass you slide up and has a chat gpt/texting app vibe but with my direction. back to the checklist. break things down what i need todo each day to maximize my roi and win 1st place!"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Validated: Launch checklist system with daily quest checkpoints and integrated blog
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: daily quests, blog system, content automation, ROI optimization, competition goals
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Cut-off timing, brand safety filters, tutorial automation scope
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Daily quest completion workflow and blog content management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ 15 testable requirements for checklist and blog systems
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Quest checkpoints, blog posts, content filters, graphics assets
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - cut-off timing and automation scope need clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a project owner preparing for a competitive launch, I need a daily quest checklist system that tracks completion of essential tasks before daily cut-offs, combined with an automated blog that transforms my development work into publishable content while protecting sensitive information, so that I can maximize ROI and maintain competitive advantage through consistent content creation and task completion.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new day begins, **When** I access the launch checklist, **Then** I see today's quest checkpoints with clear completion criteria and time remaining until cut-off
2. **Given** I complete a daily quest, **When** I mark it as done, **Then** the system tracks progress and updates ROI metrics toward first place goal
3. **Given** new journal entries, logs, or specs are created, **When** the content automation runs, **Then** blog posts are generated from safe content while filtering out brand-sensitive information
4. **Given** I need blog graphics, **When** I access the design system, **Then** I have templates and guidelines for creating theme-consistent hero backgrounds and featured images
5. **Given** blog posts are ready, **When** I schedule them, **Then** 4-10 posts are queued with proper pane-style layout matching the app's glass slide aesthetic

### Edge Cases
- What happens when daily cut-off time passes with incomplete quests?
- How does the system handle sensitive information in automated blog content?
- What occurs when graphics don't match the established theme?
- How does the blog system maintain tutorial quality when automating from development logs?

## Requirements
