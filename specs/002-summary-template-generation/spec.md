# Feature Specification: Summary Template Generation System

**Feature Branch**: `002-summary-template-generation`
**Created**: September 18, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Summary Template Generation System - Multiple AI-powered summary formats (bullets, paragraph, sentiment, Q&A) for video content analysis"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified need for multiple summary generation templates
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: template variety, content analysis, user selection, format consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked content quality standards and template switching behavior
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Focus on template selection and content quality validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each template must provide distinct value and consistent quality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Templates, generated content, source materials (transcripts/comments)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Emphasized user experience over technical generation methods
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has processed a YouTube video and wants to consume the content in different formats depending on their current context and information needs. They can quickly switch between Bullet Highlights for rapid scanning, Concise Paragraph for overview understanding, Sentiment Pulse to gauge community reaction, and Q&A Snapshot for specific information retrieval. Each template presents the same source content through a different lens, optimized for different consumption patterns and time constraints.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a processed video with transcript and comments, **When** the user selects "Bullet Highlights", **Then** the system displays 5-8 concise bullet points highlighting key ideas and actionable insights
2. **Given** the same processed video, **When** the user switches to "Concise Paragraph", **Then** the system displays a 3-5 sentence summary capturing the video's thesis, structure, and conclusion
3. **Given** a video with available comments, **When** the user selects "Sentiment Pulse", **Then** the system displays community reaction analysis with overall tone and 2-3 common themes
4. **Given** any processed video, **When** the user chooses "Q&A Snapshot", **Then** the system presents 3 relevant question-answer pairs addressing core content and viewer concerns
5. **Given** multiple template options, **When** the user switches between templates, **Then** each template loads instantly without requiring regeneration

### Edge Cases
- What happens when video content is insufficient for meaningful bullet points?
- How does Sentiment Pulse behave when comments are disabled or minimal?
- What occurs when transcript quality is poor or contains significant gaps?
- How does the system handle videos with controversial or polarizing content?
- What happens with very technical content that may not translate well to general summaries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide exactly four distinct summary templates: Bullet Highlights, Concise Paragraph, Sentiment Pulse, and Q&A Snapshot
- **FR-002**: Bullet Highlights template MUST generate 5-8 concise points focusing on core ideas, actionable insights, and key takeaways
- **FR-003**: Concise Paragraph template MUST create 3-5 sentences capturing the video's main thesis, structure, and conclusion
- **FR-004**: Sentiment Pulse template MUST analyze comment sentiment and identify 2-3 dominant community themes when comments are available
- **FR-005**: Q&A Snapshot template MUST generate 3 relevant question-answer pairs addressing core content and common viewer concerns
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate all templates from the same source materials (transcript and comments) ensuring consistency
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow instant switching between templates without regeneration delays
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain consistent quality standards across all templates regardless of source content length
- **FR-009**: System MUST gracefully handle missing source materials (e.g., no transcript, no comments) by adapting template content appropriately
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure generated content is mobile-friendly with appropriate formatting and readability
- **FR-011**: System MUST store generated templates for immediate retrieval and future reference
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear indicators when template generation fails or produces insufficient content
- **FR-013**: System MUST complete template generation within 10 seconds of user selection
- **FR-014**: System MUST ensure templates remain focused and relevant to the original video content
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle content moderation by filtering inappropriate or sensitive material from summaries

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Template Type**: Enumerated format options (bullets, paragraph, sentiment, qa) with specific generation rules and output requirements
- **Generated Summary**: Processed content output for each template type, including creation timestamp and source material references
- **Source Material**: Combined transcript and comment data used as input for all template generation processes
- **Content Quality Metrics**: Indicators of generation success, content relevance, and user satisfaction for continuous improvement
