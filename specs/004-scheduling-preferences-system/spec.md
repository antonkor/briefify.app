**Feature Branch**: `004-scheduling-preferences-system`
**Created**: September 18, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Scheduling & Preferences System - User preferences for automated summary delivery with daily/weekly/monthly options and channel preferences"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Identified need for automated scheduling and delivery channel management
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: schedule frequency, delivery channels, preference persistence, automation readiness
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked future channel integration details and notification preferences
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Focus on preference setting and future automation preparation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Balanced current mock functionality with future scalability
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Preferences, schedules, delivery channels, automation settings
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Emphasized user control and future-ready design
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user finds value in regular YouTube content analysis and wants to automate the process for specific channels or types of content. They configure their preferences for how frequently they want summaries (daily, weekly, monthly), which delivery channels they prefer (email, SMS, Discord), and what types of content to prioritize. While actual delivery is simulated initially, the interface and preference storage prepare for future automation capabilities, allowing users to experience the full workflow and refine their preferences before real automation begins.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants regular updates, **When** they access scheduling preferences, **Then** they can select from frequency options: None, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly
2. **Given** frequency selection, **When** the user chooses Daily, **Then** the system stores this preference and shows it will check for new content each day
3. **Given** delivery channel options, **When** the user views channel preferences, **Then** they see toggles for Email, SMS, and Discord with "Coming Soon" labels
4. **Given** configured preferences, **When** the user tests delivery channels, **Then** the system shows mock previews of how summaries would be delivered
5. **Given** saved preferences, **When** the user returns to the app, **Then** their scheduling and channel preferences persist across sessions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user sets preferences but no new content is available for their schedule?
- How does the system handle preference conflicts (e.g., daily summaries for infrequently posting channels)?
- What occurs when delivery channels become temporarily unavailable during scheduled sends?
- How does the system manage preferences for users who don't provide contact information for channels?
- What happens to scheduling when videos are deleted or channels become private?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide four scheduling frequency options: None, Daily, Weekly, and Monthly
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist user scheduling preferences across browser sessions and device usage
- **FR-003**: System MUST display three delivery channel options: Email, SMS, and Discord with appropriate "Coming Soon" indicators
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to mock-test delivery channels with preview functionality
- **FR-005**: System MUST store delivery channel preferences even when channels are not yet active
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback when preferences are saved or updated
- **FR-007**: System MUST scaffold backend scheduling infrastructure to support future automation
- **FR-008**: System MUST associate scheduling preferences with specific videos or channels for targeted automation
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide preference management interface optimized for mobile interaction
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle preference updates gracefully without requiring full page reloads
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate delivery channel contact information when provided (email format, phone number format)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear explanations of what each scheduling frequency means and when deliveries would occur
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to easily disable or modify scheduling without losing historical preferences
- **FR-014**: System MUST prepare for future integration with actual delivery services while maintaining current mock functionality
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide export capability for user preferences to facilitate future data migration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Schedule Preference**: User's selected frequency (none/daily/weekly/monthly) with associated timing and scope settings
- **Delivery Channel**: Available communication methods (email/SMS/Discord) with activation status and user contact information
- **Contact Information**: User-provided details for each delivery channel including validation status and opt-in preferences
- **Automation Schedule**: Backend scheduling framework prepared for future cron job integration and delivery orchestration
