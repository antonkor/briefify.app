# Feature Specification: Implementation Task for 011 App Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `012-task-011`
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "task 011"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
    Identified: Implementation task for 011-refactor-app-lets specification
2. Extract key concepts from description
    Identified: task execution, implementation planning, development workflow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which phase of the 4-phase refactoring plan should be implemented first?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this task include testing setup for refactored components?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
    Defined developer workflow scenarios for implementing refactoring
5. Generate Functional Requirements
    Each requirement focuses on implementation deliverables
6. Identify Key Entities (implementation artifacts)
    Identified components, hooks, and files to be created
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for implementation)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT needs to be implemented and WHY it delivers value
- L Avoid specific code implementations (focus on deliverables and outcomes)
- =e Written for development teams executing the refactoring plan

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer implementing the 011 refactoring specification, I need clear implementation guidance and deliverable definitions so that I can systematically execute the architectural improvements while maintaining application functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the 011 refactoring specification exists, **When** a developer starts implementation, **Then** they have clear phase-by-phase tasks with measurable deliverables
2. **Given** the monolithic component needs refactoring, **When** a developer extracts the first custom hook, **Then** the main component's line count decreases and functionality remains identical
3. **Given** custom hooks are extracted, **When** a developer tests the refactored code, **Then** all existing functionality works without regressions
4. **Given** components are separated, **When** a developer needs to modify specific functionality, **Then** they can locate and change code in focused, single-responsibility files
5. **Given** the refactoring is complete, **When** a new developer examines the codebase, **Then** they can understand individual features without reading massive files

### Edge Cases
- What happens when extracted components create circular dependencies?
- How does the system handle state synchronization issues during component separation?
- What occurs when TypeScript compilation breaks during incremental refactoring?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Implementation MUST follow the 4-phase approach defined in 011 specification (custom hooks ’ state management ’ UI components ’ advanced features)
- **FR-002**: Implementation MUST maintain 100% functional parity with existing application behavior during refactoring
- **FR-003**: Implementation MUST reduce main page.tsx component from 2,207 lines to under 150 lines
- **FR-004**: Implementation MUST create minimum 8 custom hooks for reusable logic (analytics, scroll, loading, video data, comments, favorites, workshop, initial loading)
- **FR-005**: Implementation MUST create minimum 15 focused components with maximum 200 lines each
- **FR-006**: Implementation MUST include TypeScript interfaces for all new component props and hook return types
- **FR-007**: Implementation MUST organize new files in logical directory structure reflecting feature boundaries
- **FR-008**: Implementation MUST include unit tests for all extracted custom hooks
- **FR-009**: Implementation MUST include integration tests for all separated components
- **FR-010**: Implementation MUST document all component interfaces and hook APIs
- **FR-011**: Implementation MUST eliminate all commented-out imports and unused code
- **FR-012**: Implementation MUST preserve existing CSS classes and styling behavior
- **FR-013**: Implementation MUST maintain existing PostHog analytics tracking functionality
- **FR-014**: Implementation MUST ensure scroll animations and effects work identically to current behavior
- **FR-015**: Implementation MUST verify loading states and transitions function exactly as before

*Clarifications needed:*
- **FR-016**: Implementation MUST complete [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific phase or all phases of the refactoring plan?]
- **FR-017**: Implementation MUST include [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance testing to ensure no degradation?]

### Key Entities

- **Custom Hooks**: Extracted logic units (useAnalytics, useScrollEffects, useVideoData, useLoadingStates, useCommentManagement, useFavorites, useWorkshopMode, useInitialLoading)
- **Component Files**: Separated UI units (LoadingOverlay, ProgressBar, VideoInputForm, NewUrlForm, VideoCard, InsightsList, CommentViewer, CommentFilters, WorkshopControls)
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces for props, state, and data structures
- **Test Files**: Unit and integration tests for all extracted components and hooks
- **Documentation Files**: API documentation for component interfaces and hook usage
- **Directory Structure**: Organized file system reflecting feature boundaries (hooks/, components/video/, components/comments/, components/loading/)
