# Feature Specification: Development Journal System

**Feature Branch**: `008-journal-spec-create`
**Created**: September 19, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "journal spec. create a spec for the journal. i want to write about my journey developing this and interesting things i learn. and implementation notes on this app."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature: Development journal for documenting journey and learnings
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Developer/Author, Stakeholders, Blog readers
   � Actions: Write entries, track development progress, share insights
   � Data: Journal entries, implementation notes, learning insights
   � Constraints: Regular updates, stakeholder-friendly format
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [RESOLVED: Clear intent for development documentation]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow: Create entries � Document insights � Share with stakeholders
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Journal entries, development insights, implementation notes
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All requirements clear and business-focused
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer documenting the Briefify journey, I want to maintain a structured journal of development insights, implementation decisions, and learning experiences so that stakeholders can follow the project's evolution and the content can be repurposed for blog posts and knowledge sharing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I complete a significant development milestone, **When** I create a journal entry, **Then** the entry captures both technical achievements and business impact in stakeholder-friendly language
2. **Given** I discover an interesting implementation approach, **When** I document it in the journal, **Then** the insight is preserved with context for future reference and potential blog content
3. **Given** stakeholders want to understand project progress, **When** they review journal entries, **Then** they can clearly see development velocity, challenges overcome, and strategic decisions made
4. **Given** I want to create blog content, **When** I review journal entries, **Then** I have well-structured material covering the development journey with both technical depth and business context

### Edge Cases
- What happens when development work doesn't result in user-visible progress (refactoring, infrastructure)?
- How does the system handle sensitive information that shouldn't be public (API keys, internal decisions)?
- What format ensures both stakeholder readability and blog-ready content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a structured format for capturing development insights and implementation decisions
- **FR-002**: Journal entries MUST include both technical achievements and business impact metrics
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to document learning experiences and interesting discoveries during development
- **FR-004**: System MUST organize entries chronologically with clear date stamps and project context
- **FR-005**: Journal entries MUST be written in stakeholder-friendly language while preserving technical depth
- **FR-006**: System MUST support categorization of content (development insights, business impact, learning notes)
- **FR-007**: Journal MUST capture development velocity metrics and time savings achieved
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable easy conversion of journal content to blog post format
- **FR-009**: Journal entries MUST include strategic recommendations for future development
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain consistent formatting for professional presentation
- **FR-011**: System MUST support structured tagging scheme for integration with Convex database
- **FR-012**: Journal entries MUST include machine-readable metadata for automated processing and insights extraction

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Journal Entry**: Date-stamped development documentation including technical achievements, business impact, insights, and strategic recommendations
- **Development Insight**: Specific learning or discovery made during implementation, with context and potential applications
- **Implementation Note**: Technical decisions and approaches used, documented for future reference and knowledge sharing
- **Stakeholder Update**: Business-focused summary of progress, metrics, and strategic value delivered
- **Blog Content**: Journal entries formatted and refined for public consumption and thought leadership
