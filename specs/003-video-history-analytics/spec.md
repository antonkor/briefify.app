## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user regularly processes YouTube videos for work or personal research and wants to easily revisit previously analyzed content without reprocessing. They can access a chronological history of all processed videos, quickly find specific content using search or filters, and review past summaries. Meanwhile, the system quietly tracks usage patterns to improve performance and user experience, providing insights into which templates are most valuable and how the service is being used across different contexts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has processed multiple videos over time, **When** they access the History section, **Then** they see a chronological list of all processed videos with thumbnails, titles, and processing dates
2. **Given** an extensive video history, **When** the user searches for specific content, **Then** the system quickly filters results by video title, channel name, or summary content
3. **Given** a historical video entry, **When** the user selects it, **Then** they can access all previously generated summaries and metadata without reprocessing
4. **Given** ongoing system usage, **When** analytics events are captured, **Then** the system tracks user interactions while respecting privacy boundaries
5. **Given** accumulated analytics data, **When** system administrators review usage patterns, **Then** they can identify popular features, performance bottlenecks, and user engagement trends

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user accesses the service across multiple devices or browsers?
- How does the system handle history when the original YouTube video becomes unavailable?
- What occurs with analytics when users have ad blockers or privacy tools enabled?
- How does the system manage history for users who clear their browser data frequently?
- What happens to analytics data when external tracking services are temporarily unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain a persistent history of all processed videos for each user session
- **FR-002**: History MUST display video metadata including title, channel, thumbnail, processing date, and summary count
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide search functionality across video titles, channel names, and summary content
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to access previously generated summaries without requiring reprocessing
- **FR-005**: System MUST retain video history for a minimum of 30 days from last access
- **FR-006**: System MUST track key analytics events including app opens, URL submissions, processing completions, template selections, and email previews
- **FR-007**: Analytics MUST capture performance metrics including processing times, success rates, and error frequencies
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide analytics dashboard showing usage patterns, popular templates, and system health metrics
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement privacy-respecting analytics that do not track personally identifiable information
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle analytics gracefully when external tracking services are unavailable
- **FR-011**: History interface MUST be optimized for mobile browsing with touch-friendly navigation
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide export capability for user's video history and summaries
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement efficient pagination for users with extensive video histories
- **FR-014**: Analytics MUST support funnel analysis from URL submission to summary completion
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear user controls for history management and data deletion

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **History Record**: Individual video processing session with metadata, timestamps, and references to generated summaries
- **Analytics Event**: Discrete user interaction or system event with timestamp, type, and relevant context data
- **User Session**: Temporary identifier for grouping related activities and maintaining history continuity within browser session
- **Usage Metrics**: Aggregated data about feature utilization, performance trends, and user engagement patterns
