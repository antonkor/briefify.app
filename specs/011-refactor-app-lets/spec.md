# Feature Specification: App Architecture Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `011-refactor-app-lets`
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "refactor-app: lets analize the bapp and see what sections are easiest to refactor. then look at the specs for each things and make a plan to refactor atlest 50% of the app codebase if not more. also document the issues we're looking at here and try to solve them in the refactoring"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
    Analyzed: Need to refactor 50%+ of app codebase, focusing on easiest sections first
2. Extract key concepts from description
    Identified: component separation, state management, architecture cleanup
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we preserve existing UI/UX exactly or allow minor improvements?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there specific performance targets for the refactored code?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
    Defined user scenarios for maintainability and development experience
5. Generate Functional Requirements
    Each requirement focuses on code organization and maintainability
6. Identify Key Entities (architectural components)
    Identified core architectural entities to be refactored
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT the refactored architecture should provide and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no specific tech stack details, just architectural patterns)
- =e Written for development teams and technical stakeholders

## Current Architecture Issues Identified

### Critical Problems
1. **Monolithic Component**: Main page.tsx is 2,207 lines with 20+ state variables
2. **No Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, state management, and data fetching all mixed
3. **Complex State Management**: 20+ useState hooks managing interdependent state
4. **Unused Component Architecture**: Commented imports indicate incomplete previous refactoring
5. **No Custom Hooks**: All logic inline instead of reusable hook patterns
6. **Mixed Responsibilities**: Single component handles analytics, scroll effects, loading states, video data, comments, and UI rendering

### Impact on Development
- **Difficult to Maintain**: Changes require understanding entire 2,207-line file
- **Hard to Test**: No isolated units to test independently
- **Poor Reusability**: Logic cannot be shared across components
- **Debugging Complexity**: State interactions are unclear across massive component
- **Slow Development**: Simple changes require navigating enormous file

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the application, I need a well-organized codebase where I can quickly locate and modify specific functionality without understanding the entire application, so that I can implement features efficiently and confidently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to modify video loading behavior, **When** they open the codebase, **Then** they can locate video-related logic in dedicated hooks/components within 30 seconds
2. **Given** a developer wants to add a new loading state, **When** they examine the loading logic, **Then** they find it isolated in dedicated loading management components/hooks
3. **Given** a developer needs to update comment functionality, **When** they navigate the code, **Then** comment logic is separated from video and UI logic
4. **Given** a developer wants to test scroll behavior, **When** they write tests, **Then** scroll logic is available as an isolated, testable unit
5. **Given** a new developer joins the team, **When** they explore the codebase, **Then** they can understand individual features without reading 2,000+ lines of code

### Edge Cases
- What happens when refactored components need to share complex state?
- How does the system handle state synchronization between newly separated components?
- What occurs when circular dependencies emerge during component separation?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST separate the 2,207-line main component into focused, single-responsibility components (max 200 lines each)
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract all state management logic into custom hooks organized by feature domain
- **FR-003**: System MUST create dedicated components for video analysis, comment management, and loading states
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement a clear data flow pattern where state flows unidirectionally between components
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain exact existing user interface and functionality during refactoring
- **FR-006**: System MUST organize components in a logical directory structure reflecting feature boundaries
- **FR-007**: System MUST extract all analytics and tracking logic into dedicated utility hooks
- **FR-008**: System MUST separate scroll and animation effects into reusable custom hooks
- **FR-009**: System MUST create typed interfaces for all data structures and component props
- **FR-010**: System MUST enable independent testing of each separated component and hook
- **FR-011**: System MUST reduce the main page component to under 150 lines by delegating to smaller components
- **FR-012**: System MUST eliminate commented-out code and unused imports throughout the codebase
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement consistent error boundaries for each major feature section
- **FR-014**: System MUST create a standardized loading state management system across all components
- **FR-015**: System MUST document component interfaces and hook APIs for maintainability

*Clarifications needed:*
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain performance characteristics [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance targets for refactored code?]
- **FR-017**: System MUST preserve existing UI behavior [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: are minor UX improvements allowed during refactoring?]

### Key Entities

- **Component Modules**: Focused UI components handling single responsibilities (VideoPlayer, CommentSection, LoadingOverlay, AnalyticsWrapper)
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable state and effect logic (useVideoData, useScrollEffects, useLoadingStates, useAnalytics, useCommentManagement)
- **State Containers**: Centralized state management for complex interactions (video analysis workflow, comment interactions)
- **Utility Services**: Pure functions for data transformation, API calls, and business logic
- **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures and component contracts
- **Feature Boundaries**: Clear separation between video analysis, comment management, UI state, and analytics domains

## Refactoring Priority Plan (50%+ Coverage)

### Phase 1: High-Impact, Low-Risk (Immediate - Week 1)
1. **Extract Custom Hooks** (Lines ~15-120):
   - Analytics tracking hook
   - Scroll effects hook
   - Initial loading hook
   - Hero text rotation hook
2. **Separate Loading Components** (Lines ~1350-1450):
   - LoadingOverlay component
   - ProgressBar component
   - LoadingMessages component

### Phase 2: State Management Separation (Week 2)
1. **Video State Management** (Lines ~89-110):
   - useVideoAnalysis hook
   - useLoadingStages hook
2. **Comment State Management** (Lines ~98-108):
   - useCommentInteractions hook
   - useFavorites hook

### Phase 3: UI Component Extraction (Week 3)
1. **Form Components** (Lines ~1380-1500):
   - VideoInputForm component
   - NewUrlForm component
2. **Video Display** (Lines ~1400-1600):

   - CommentFilters component
2. **Workshop Mode** (Lines ~1850-1950):
   - WorkshopControls component

### Coverage Analysis
- **Estimated Lines Refactored**: ~1,400+ lines (63% of main component)
- **Components Created**: 15+ focused components
- **Custom Hooks**: 8+ reusable hooks
- **Complexity Reduction**: From 1 massive component to 20+ focused units
