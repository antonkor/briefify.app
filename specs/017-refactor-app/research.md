# Research: Application Refactor

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Feature**: Application Refactor (017-refactor-app)

## Executive Summary
Research findings for refactoring Briefify application to address build conflicts, error handling, performance, and maintainability issues.

## 1. React 19 Error Boundaries

### Decision: Component-Level Error Boundaries with Fallback UI
**Rationale**: React 19 maintains error boundary API with improved dev tools integration. Component-level boundaries prevent entire app crashes.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Global error boundary in root layout
- Feature-specific boundaries for isolated failures
- Graceful fallback UI with retry capabilities
- Error reporting to monitoring service

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single global boundary only (rejected: insufficient granularity)
- Try-catch in every component (rejected: not React idiomatic)
- External error service (deferred: adds complexity)

## 2. Next.js 15 Build Optimization

### Decision: Custom Cache Directory Outside Sync Paths
**Rationale**: File sync services (OneDrive, Dropbox) cause lock conflicts with .next directory. Moving cache prevents conflicts.

**Implementation Strategy**:
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  distDir: process.env.NEXT_BUILD_DIR || '.next',
  // Set NEXT_BUILD_DIR to path outside OneDrive
}
```

**Build Optimizations**:
- Incremental Static Regeneration for mock data
- SWC minification (default in Next.js 15)
- Tree shaking for unused code
- Image optimization with next/image

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Webpack cache configuration (rejected: Next.js handles internally)
- Turbopack (deferred: still experimental)
- External build service (rejected: adds complexity)

## 3. File System Conflict Resolution

### Decision: Exclusion Lists + Alternative Cache Paths
**Rationale**: Cannot always control user's sync settings, so app must be resilient.

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Document exclusion process for users
2. Detect sync service presence
3. Use alternative paths when detected
4. Implement file lock retry logic

**Detection Code**:
```javascript
const isOneDrive = process.cwd().includes('OneDrive');
const isDropbox = process.cwd().includes('Dropbox');
const isiCloud = process.cwd().includes('iCloud Drive');
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Force users to move project (rejected: poor UX)
- Disable caching entirely (rejected: performance impact)
- Virtual file system (rejected: overcomplicated)

## 4. Performance Monitoring

### Decision: Web Vitals + Custom Metrics
**Rationale**: Native browser APIs provide accurate performance data without external dependencies.

**Metrics to Track**:
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS
- **Custom Metrics**:
  - Component render time
  - Data fetch duration
  - Animation frame rate
  - Memory usage trends

**Implementation Strategy**:
```javascript
// Using web-vitals library (lightweight)
import { getCLS, getFID, getLCP } from 'web-vitals';

// Custom performance observer
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  // Log to analytics
});
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full APM solution (rejected: overkill for current scale)
- Manual timing only (rejected: misses important metrics)
- Server-side only (rejected: misses client performance)

## 5. State Management Patterns

### Decision: Custom Hooks + Context API
**Rationale**: Application size doesn't justify Redux/Zustand. Custom hooks provide reusability with React's built-in state.

**Pattern**:
```typescript
// useVideoAnalysis.ts
export function useVideoAnalysis() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  // Business logic here
  return { state, actions };
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux Toolkit (rejected: overcomplicated for current needs)
- Zustand (rejected: additional dependency)
- Prop drilling (rejected: maintainability issues)

## 6. Testing Strategy

### Decision: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
**Rationale**: Industry standard tools with excellent Next.js support.

**Test Pyramid**:
- **Unit Tests** (70%): Utils, hooks, pure components
- **Integration Tests** (20%): User flows, data flows
- **E2E Tests** (10%): Critical paths only

**Coverage Goals**:
- 80% statement coverage
- 100% for error boundaries
- 100% for data validation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Vitest (rejected: Jest more mature with Next.js)
- Cypress (rejected: Playwright better for components)
- Enzyme (rejected: deprecated for React 18+)

## 7. Component Architecture

### Decision: Atomic Design Principles
**Rationale**: Provides clear hierarchy and reusability.

**Structure**:
```
components/
├── atoms/       # Buttons, inputs, labels
├── molecules/   # Form groups, cards
├── organisms/   # Headers, sections
├── templates/   # Page layouts
└── pages/       # Full pages
```

**Naming Convention**:
- PascalCase for components
- Index files for clean imports
- Co-located styles and tests

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Feature-based structure (rejected: too much nesting)
- Flat structure (rejected: scales poorly)
- Domain-driven (deferred: premature for current size)

## 8. Development Workflow

### Decision: Automated Checks + Documentation
**Rationale**: Prevent issues before they reach repository.

**Workflow Tools**:
- Pre-commit hooks (Husky)
- Linting (ESLint + Prettier)
- Type checking (TypeScript strict)
- Automated tests on push

**Documentation Strategy**:
- README with troubleshooting
- Inline JSDoc comments
- Storybook for components (future)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- No automation (rejected: relies on discipline)
- CI-only checks (rejected: slow feedback)
- Full GitOps (rejected: overcomplicated)

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
1. Move .next cache directory
2. Add global error boundary
3. Document OneDrive exclusion

### Phase 2: Stability (Week 1)
1. Component error boundaries
2. Data validation layer
3. Retry logic for failures

### Phase 3: Performance (Week 2)
1. Implement monitoring
2. Add lazy loading
3. Optimize re-renders

### Phase 4: Quality (Week 3)
1. Setup testing infrastructure
2. Add pre-commit hooks
3. Complete documentation

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking changes | High | Incremental refactoring with tests |
| Performance regression | Medium | Benchmark before/after |
| Developer confusion | Low | Clear documentation |
| Sync conflicts persist | Medium | Multiple mitigation strategies |

## Success Criteria
- Zero OneDrive-related build failures
- All errors caught and logged
- Page load <2s on average hardware
- 80% test coverage achieved
- Developer setup <5 minutes
