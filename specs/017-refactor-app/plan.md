   → Set Structure Decision: Maintaining existing structure with improvements
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document
   → Using test-first approach for new error boundaries
   → Simplicity principle for refactoring approach
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → No violations - refactoring improves simplicity
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check ✓
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Research best practices for error boundaries, performance, build optimization
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
   → Define refactored component structure and error contracts
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Improvements align with simplicity and testability principles
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check ✓
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Comprehensive refactoring of Briefify application to address critical issues: build system conflicts, missing error handling, performance bottlenecks, and code organization. Focus on developer experience improvements and production stability through systematic technical debt reduction.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x / JavaScript ES2022
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15.5, React 19, Tailwind CSS, PostHog
**Storage**: Mock JSON data files (transitioning to Convex)
**Testing**: Jest (to be configured), React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
**Project Type**: web - Next.js application
**Performance Goals**: <2s initial load, <300ms transitions, 60fps animations
**Constraints**: Must work with file sync services, handle missing data gracefully
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page application with video analysis features

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle Alignment
- ✅ **Test-First**: Error boundaries and new components will follow TDD
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Refactoring reduces complexity, not adds to it
- ✅ **Observability**: Adding comprehensive error logging
- ✅ **Performance**: Clear metrics and monitoring being added
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Improving code structure and documentation

### Complexity Tracking
- No new complex patterns being introduced
- Simplifying existing state management
- Consolidating duplicate logic
- Standardizing component patterns

**Structure Decision**: Maintain Next.js app directory structure with organizational improvements

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - Best practices for React 19 error boundaries
   - Next.js 15 build optimization strategies
   - File sync service conflict resolution patterns
   - Performance monitoring implementation

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research React 19 error boundary patterns for production apps"
   Task: "Find Next.js 15 build cache optimization strategies"
   Task: "Research file system conflict resolution for OneDrive/Dropbox"
   Task: "Find performance monitoring best practices for React apps"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what approach to use]
   - Rationale: [why this approach]
   - Alternatives considered: [other options evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with refactoring strategies documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Error types and structures
   - Performance metrics schema
   - Configuration models
   - Component prop interfaces

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Error reporting contract
   - Performance metrics contract
   - Configuration management contract
   - Output to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Error boundary behavior tests
   - Performance threshold tests
   - Configuration validation tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Developer setup experience
   - Error recovery flows
   - Performance under load
   - Build system reliability

5. **Update CLAUDE.md incrementally**:
   - Add refactoring guidelines
   - Document new patterns
   - Include troubleshooting tips

**Outputs**:
- `data-model.md`: Refactored data structures
- `contracts/`: Error and performance contracts
- `quickstart.md`: Developer onboarding guide
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`: AI assistant context

## Phase 2: Task Generation (for /tasks command)
*Prerequisites: Phase 0-1 complete*

**Approach**:
1. Group tasks by dependency order:
   - Critical fixes first (build, errors)
   - Performance improvements second
   - Code organization third
   - Documentation parallel throughout

2. Mark parallel tasks with [P]:
   - Different file modifications
   - Independent improvements
   - Documentation tasks

3. Create atomic, testable tasks:
   - One file, one purpose
   - Clear success criteria
   - Measurable outcomes

## Validation
- [ ] All 20 functional requirements addressed
- [ ] No new complexity introduced
- [ ] Test-first approach for new code
- [ ] Build conflicts resolved
- [ ] Performance metrics defined

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental refactoring with tests
- **Risk**: Performance regression
  - **Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after each change
- **Risk**: Developer workflow disruption
  - **Mitigation**: Document all changes clearly

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Initial Constitution Check
- [x] Phase 0: Research (complete - research.md created)
- [x] Phase 1: Design & Contracts (complete - all artifacts created)
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check
- [ ] Phase 2: Task Generation (ready for /tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Phase 4: Integration & Polish
