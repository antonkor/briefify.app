# Feature Specification: Application Refactor

**Feature Branch**: `017-refactor-app`
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "refactor app"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extract need for application refactoring
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: code structure, performance, maintainability, reliability
3. For each refactor area:
   ’ Define specific improvements needed
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Focus on stability and performance improvements
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement addresses specific technical debt
   ’ All improvements must be measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (components and systems to refactor)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Verify all refactoring goals are clear
   ’ Ensure scope is well-defined
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT needs refactoring and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no specific code patterns)
- =e Written for development team and stakeholders

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I need a well-structured, performant, and maintainable codebase so that I can efficiently develop features, debug issues, and deploy updates without encountering recurring technical problems or performance bottlenecks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is running, **When** a user navigates between sections, **Then** all transitions complete within 300ms
2. **Given** mock data files exist, **When** the app loads video data, **Then** it handles missing or malformed data gracefully
3. **Given** multiple developers work on the project, **When** they run the app locally, **Then** setup completes without environment-specific errors
4. **Given** an error occurs in a component, **When** the error is thrown, **Then** it's caught and logged without crashing the application
5. **Given** the build system runs, **When** file changes are detected, **Then** hot reload completes within 2 seconds

### Edge Cases
- What happens when required mock data files are missing?
- How does the system handle corrupted cache or build artifacts?
- What occurs when multiple instances try to use the same port?
- How does the app behave under memory constraints?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Code Organization & Structure
- **FR-001**: Application MUST have consistent component structure and naming conventions
- **FR-002**: State management MUST follow predictable, documented patterns
- **FR-003**: Utility functions MUST be centralized and reusable
- **FR-004**: Type definitions MUST be comprehensive and properly exported

#### Performance & Optimization
- **FR-005**: Initial page load MUST complete within 2 seconds
- **FR-006**: Component re-renders MUST be minimized through proper memoization
- **FR-007**: Large lists MUST use virtualization for smooth scrolling
- **FR-008**: Static assets MUST be optimized and lazy-loaded where appropriate

#### Error Handling & Recovery
- **FR-009**: Every component MUST have proper error boundaries
- **FR-010**: Data fetching MUST include error states and retry logic
- **FR-011**: User actions MUST provide feedback for success and failure states
- **FR-012**: System MUST log errors with sufficient context for debugging

#### Build & Development
- **FR-013**: Build system MUST handle file system conflicts gracefully
- **FR-014**: Development server MUST manage ports intelligently
- **FR-015**: Build artifacts MUST be isolated from sync services
- **FR-016**: Hot module replacement MUST work consistently

#### Testing & Quality
- **FR-017**: Critical user paths MUST have integration test coverage
- **FR-018**: Utility functions MUST have unit test coverage
- **FR-019**: Components MUST be testable in isolation
- **FR-020**: Performance metrics MUST be measurable and tracked

### Key Entities

- **Component Architecture**: React components, hooks, and composition patterns
- **State Management**: Application state, data flow, and synchronization
- **Data Layer**: Mock data system, API abstraction, caching strategies
- **Build System**: Compilation, bundling, and development tooling
- **Error System**: Error boundaries, logging, and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Layer**: Optimization strategies, monitoring, and metrics
- **Test Infrastructure**: Testing frameworks, coverage, and automation

## Refactor Priority Matrix

### High Priority (Blocking Issues)
1. Build system conflicts with file sync services
2. Missing error boundaries causing app crashes
3. Port management conflicts preventing development

### Medium Priority (Performance Impact)
1. Unoptimized component re-renders
2. Large bundle sizes affecting load times
3. Missing data validation causing runtime errors

### Low Priority (Quality Improvements)
1. Inconsistent code formatting
2. Missing documentation
3. Outdated dependencies

## Success Metrics

- 50% reduction in build-related errors
- Zero uncaught runtime exceptions
- Page load time under 2 seconds
- 80% reduction in unnecessary re-renders
- 100% of components with error boundaries
