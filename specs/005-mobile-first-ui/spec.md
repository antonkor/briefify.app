## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user primarily accesses Briefify on their smartphone while commuting, during breaks, or in other mobile contexts where they want quick access to YouTube video insights. The interface adapts seamlessly to their device screen size, provides large touch targets for easy interaction, loads quickly on mobile networks, and presents information in a scannable format optimized for small screens. Navigation feels intuitive and native to mobile usage patterns, while maintaining full functionality across all features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user accesses Briefify on a mobile device, **When** the interface loads, **Then** all elements scale appropriately with touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px tap targets)
2. **Given** a mobile user, **When** they input a YouTube URL, **Then** the interface provides an optimized keyboard experience with appropriate input types and auto-complete
3. **Given** generated summaries on mobile, **When** the user reviews content, **Then** text is readable without zooming and formatted for comfortable mobile reading
4. **Given** navigation between sections, **When** the user moves through the app, **Then** transitions are smooth and navigation patterns follow mobile conventions
5. **Given** varying mobile screen sizes, **When** the interface adapts, **Then** content remains accessible and functional across devices from large phones to small screens

### Edge Cases
- How does the interface perform on very small screens or older mobile devices?
- What happens when users rotate their device between portrait and landscape orientations?
- How does the interface handle slow mobile network connections?
- What occurs when users have accessibility features enabled (large fonts, high contrast)?
- How does the app behave when mobile browsers have JavaScript restrictions or ad blockers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Interface MUST prioritize mobile design patterns with desktop as a responsive enhancement
- **FR-002**: All interactive elements MUST meet minimum touch target size of 44px for optimal mobile usability
- **FR-003**: System MUST load and render initial interface within 3 seconds on typical mobile networks
- **FR-004**: Navigation MUST follow established mobile conventions with intuitive gesture support and clear visual hierarchy
- **FR-005**: Text content MUST be readable without zoom across all mobile device screen sizes
- **FR-006**: Interface MUST adapt seamlessly to both portrait and landscape orientations
- **FR-007**: System MUST optimize images and media for mobile bandwidth and storage constraints
- **FR-008**: Touch interactions MUST provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions
- **FR-009**: Interface MUST support mobile browser features including pull-to-refresh and native sharing
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain full feature functionality across mobile browsers without desktop-only dependencies
- **FR-011**: Layout MUST use responsive design principles to scale effectively from 320px to 1200px+ screen widths
- **FR-012**: Interface MUST meet WCAG accessibility standards for mobile users with disabilities
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle mobile-specific input methods including voice input and camera-based URL capture
- **FR-014**: Navigation MUST minimize the number of taps required to complete primary user flows
- **FR-015**: Interface MUST provide offline-friendly fallbacks for poor network conditions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive interface structure that scales fluidly across device sizes and orientations
- **Touch Interface**: Interactive elements optimized for finger-based navigation with appropriate sizing and spacing
- **Mobile Navigation**: Streamlined navigation patterns designed for thumb-based interaction and small screen optimization
- **Performance Profile**: Mobile-specific optimization settings for loading speed, data usage, and battery efficiency
