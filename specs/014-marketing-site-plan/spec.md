# Feature Specification: Marketing Site Analytics Plan

**Feature Branch**: `014-marketing-site-plan`
**Created**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "marketing site plan: use google analytics and posthog custom tracking (what goes to what, you figure out) posthog is the backbone to our operation here, using custom events , experiements, a/b testing , watching videos and overall improvement of the product. google analtyics is for what its best for, we dont have to do much there as most of the time we'll be using post hog. but if we're creating custom events for posthog, lets do the same for google analtyics to future proof our analtitic metrics"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature: Dual analytics system with PostHog primary, GA secondary
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: marketers, product managers, developers
   � Actions: track events, run experiments, analyze behavior
   � Data: user interactions, video engagement, conversion funnels
   � Constraints: PostHog backbone, GA for future-proofing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific video tracking metrics not defined]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: A/B test success criteria not specified]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow: track user journey from landing to conversion
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (events, experiments, metrics)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Spec has uncertainties marked
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Marketing teams and product managers need comprehensive analytics to understand user behavior, optimize conversion funnels, run A/B tests, and improve product engagement through data-driven decisions. PostHog serves as the primary analytics platform for detailed behavioral insights while Google Analytics provides standard web metrics and future-proofing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the briefify.app landing page, **When** they interact with any element, **Then** both PostHog and Google Analytics capture the event
2. **Given** a marketing manager wants to run an A/B test, **When** they create an experiment in PostHog, **Then** user traffic is automatically split and tracked
3. **Given** a user watches a video demo, **When** they play, pause, or complete the video, **Then** engagement metrics are captured in both analytics platforms
4. **Given** a product manager reviews analytics, **When** they access the PostHog dashboard, **Then** they see custom events, funnels, and user session recordings
5. **Given** a user converts from visitor to customer, **When** they complete the signup flow, **Then** the conversion funnel is tracked end-to-end

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PostHog is unavailable but Google Analytics is working?
- How does system handle users with ad blockers or analytics blockers?
- What occurs when custom events fail to send to one platform but succeed on the other?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### PostHog Primary Analytics
- **FR-001**: System MUST track all user interactions as custom events in PostHog
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture video engagement metrics (play, pause, completion percentages)
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable A/B testing capabilities through PostHog experiments
- **FR-004**: System MUST record user session replays for behavior analysis
- **FR-005**: System MUST track conversion funnels from landing page to signup completion
- **FR-006**: System MUST capture feature flag usage and experiment participation
- **FR-007**: System MUST track custom events for product improvement insights

#### Google Analytics Secondary Tracking
- **FR-008**: System MUST mirror all PostHog custom events to Google Analytics for future-proofing
- **FR-009**: System MUST track standard web metrics (page views, sessions, bounce rate)
- **FR-010**: System MUST capture goal conversions and e-commerce events
- **FR-011**: System MUST track traffic sources and campaign performance
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide demographic and geographic user insights

#### Cross-Platform Requirements
- **FR-013**: System MUST ensure consistent event naming between PostHog and Google Analytics
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle analytics failures gracefully without affecting user experience
- **FR-015**: System MUST comply with privacy regulations and cookie consent
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide real-time event tracking capabilities
- **FR-017**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data retention periods for each platform not specified]
- **FR-018**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific video engagement thresholds not defined]
- **FR-019**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: A/B test sample size and statistical significance criteria not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Custom Event**: User interaction with specific properties (event name, timestamp, user ID, custom properties)
- **Experiment**: A/B test configuration with variants, success metrics, and participant tracking
- **Conversion Funnel**: Multi-step user journey from awareness to conversion with drop-off points
- **Video Engagement Metrics**: Play time, completion rate, interaction points, drop-off analysis
- **User Session**: Complete user visit with all interactions, page views, and behavioral data
- **Feature Flag**: Product feature toggles with usage tracking and experiment integration
- **Campaign Attribution**: Traffic source tracking with UTM parameters and conversion mapping
